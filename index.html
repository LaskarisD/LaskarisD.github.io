<h2>Project Work</h2>
<h3>Winds of Fire</h3>
<p>Worked with three other students to build this small Unity game. The goal of 
    the game is to defeat the boss wizard at the end of a maze-like level. Your
    weapons are useless to the wizard, but you can use them to convert smaller
    enemies around the maze to follow and fight for you. Gameplay wise mainly
    used C# to implement enemy AI steering behaviours such as wandering
    and obstacle avoidance. Helped integration of wave function collapse
    for procedural level generation to ensure that no paths were blocked off.
    Also individually applied deep reinforcement learning to the game with an agent playing a smaller scale version of the game.</p>

<h3>Asteroids-like Game (2D and 3D Version)</h3>
<p>Individually made 2D and 3D versions of games similar to classic game Asteroids
     using C++ and OpenGL. Built the game from scratch, manually coding wireframes,
      movement, collision responses and UI for 2D version. 3D version built upon
       the 2D code, making changes where necessary to add the 3rd dimension as
        well as implementing texturing and lighting and shading with OpenGL
         for the 3D objects. </p>

<h3>Azul Text Game</h3>
