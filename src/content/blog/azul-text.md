## Azul Text Game
Worked in a group of three to create text-based version of board game Azul played
in the command line. Involves strategically placing coloured tiles on a board
and score points depending how the coloured tiles matchup with a given pattern.
Created in C++ with focus on object oriented programming andabstract data types
along with dynamic memory management. Main contribution wasimplementing abstract
data types and logic for objects in game such as Tilebag,Tile and Centre Factory.
Also helped implement gameplay logic for actual round of game.
