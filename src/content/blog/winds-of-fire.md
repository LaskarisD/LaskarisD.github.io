## Winds of Fire

Worked with three other students to build this small Unity game. The goal of 
the game is to defeat the boss wizard at the end of a maze-like level. Your
weapons are useless to the wizard, but you can use them to convert smaller
enemies around the maze to follow and fight for you. Gameplay wise mainly
used C# to implement enemy AI steering behaviours such as wandering
and obstacle avoidance. Helped integration of wave function collapse
for procedural level generation to ensure that no paths were blocked off.
Also individually applied deep reinforcement learning to the game with an 
agent playing a smaller scale version of the game.
