## Asteroids-like Game (2D and 3D Version)

Individually made 2D and 3D versions of games similar to classic game Asteroids 
using C++ and OpenGL. Destroy the asteroids and survive for as long as possible.
Built the game from scratch, manually coding wireframes, movement, collision 
responses and UI for 2D version. 3D version built upon the 2D code, making
changes where necessary to add the 3rd dimension as well as implementing
texturing and lighting and shading with OpenGL for the 3D objects.
