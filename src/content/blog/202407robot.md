## Ur5e Robot Arm Playing Connect4
Worked within a group to design and program a UR5e robot to play a modified version of Connect4 against in collaboration with RMIT Virtual Experiences Lab. Main game was played on a 2D surface with robot simulating where a players piece would fall after placed in a certain column using lego bricks. Main contribution to this project was developing Python script that completed pick and place action for robot (i.e autonomously pick up game piece and place in corresponding location on board). Project was colaboratted using git with Github (https://github.com/Kibibibit/UR5e_Env). Project considered for use for open day demonstration and available for extension for further development in course projects.
